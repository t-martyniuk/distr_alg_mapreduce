# Map Reduce emulation.

Task 2 for the Distributed Algorithms course.

Create a program that emulates MapReduce via multi-threading. 

Solve a problem of counting the number of digits that occur in a sequence (the length of the sequence is the power of 2).

Firstly, several threads "map", generating intermediate results. Then several threads "reduce" and generate the final result.
